SMM is a simple tool to keep track of your balance


Works for Windows, Linux and other Unix-Like Systems

Just compile the Program with gcc "gcc main.c -o smm" or for Windows "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe .\main.c -o .\smm.exe"

A Windows binary is also available in the Realeases.

Note that this Program will create a .txt file to store your balance in the directory you open it.
